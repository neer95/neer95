### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Neeraj

I'm passionate about building clean, responsive websites using HTML and CSS. I also enjoy working with data â€” exploring business intelligence tools and turning numbers into insights.

On this profile, you'll find web development projects as well as hands-on experiments in data analysis.

Thanks for visiting!
